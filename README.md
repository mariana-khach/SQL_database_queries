This repository contains dfferent databases with corresponding queries. I have used PosgreSQL with pgAdmin and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
Facility_bookings and Movie_rental repositories contain .tar files that can be used in pgAdmin to restore corresponding databases and run .sql files for queries.
Northwind folder contains two .sql files to create database tables and objects and load data. There is also Queries.sql file with different queries.
Folder named Creating contains different .sql files for creating databases and tables.
